/**
 * <p>Simple example illustrating: (a) using an iterator to iterate over all permutations of a
 * given length, and (b) computing the distance between a pair of permutations.  The example
 * generates a table of distances to a randomly selected permutation of length 4.  Table contains
 * one row for each of the 4! = 24 permutations of length 4, and columns for several of the distance
 * metrics from the library.</p>
 *
 * <p>Note: In general, when using the PermutationIterator, please be aware that there are N! possible 
 * permutations of length N.  Unless the permutation length is small, you will likely either want to 
 * find an alternative approach for whatever it is you're doing, or you'll need a secondary way 
 * out of the iteration.</p>
