/**
 * <p>Purpose: This example program originally served a specific purpose during development.
 * Specifically, I wanted to confirm that the use of Arrays.hashCode to implement the hashCode
 * method of the Permutation class was a good choice (i.e., did it adequately avoid collisions).
 * In general, it does a good job for arrays, but I wanted to confirm that the special nature of
 * an array containing a permutation of the integers from 0 to N-1 didn't lead to a large number of collisions.</p>
 * <p>Command line arguments: Two optional command line arguments, both integers.
 * First argument is max permutation length (default is 9).
 * Second argument is max permutation length to exhaustively print"
 * (default is 0).</p>
 * <p>Function: For each permutation length, up to 8 (or max specified on command
 * line), iterates over all permutations of that length, computing number
 * of hashCode collisions, i.e., number of permutations that share a
 * hashCode with another permutation of that length.  It does not count 
 * collisions across different length permutations.  Output includes 
 * length, collision count, and percentage of permutations of a given
 * length that collide (i.e., if N is length, the collision percentage
 * is: (#collisions / N!).</p>
 * <p>WARNING: If N is the first command line argument, runtime is at least O((N+1)!),
 * if there are relatively few collisions.  On my test system, the default
 * of N=9 is fast, while there is a slight pause for N=10, and a long wait
 * for N=11.</p>
