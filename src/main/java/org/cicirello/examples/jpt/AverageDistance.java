/**
 * <p>Simple example illustrating: (a) constructing random permutations of a given length, and 
 * (b) computing the distance between a pair of permutations.  For several of the permutation
 * distances in the library, the example computes the average distance between pairs of random
 * permutations.</p>
 *
 * <p>For the user of this example who is unfamiliar with the statistics of permutations, you should
 * expect the resulting averages to be high.  Random permutations tend to be very dissimilar.  For example,
 * the average number of fixed points in random permutations (a fixed point is a position that contains 
 * the same element) is 1 regardless of the length of the permutations.  So since ExactMatchDistance is the
 * count of the number of positions that contain different elements, on average we should expect (LENGTH - 1)
 * positions in a pair of random permutations to contain different elements.  You should expect a similar effect
 * for the other distance metrics, though they measure different characteristics of the permutations.</p>
 *
 * <p>There are two optional command line arguments.  If you specify no command line arguments, then this
 * defaults to permutations of length 100, and uses 100 pairs of random permutations to compute the averages.
 * The first command line argument is used to specify permutation length, and the second is used to specify number
 * of samples to use for computing averages.</p>
