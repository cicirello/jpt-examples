This repository contains several example programs of the 
usage of the [JavaPermutationTools (JPT)](https://jpt.cicirello.org) 
library. The JavaPermutationTools (JPT) library provides Java classes 
and interfaces, etc that enable representing and generating permutations 
and sequences, as well as performing computation on permutations and 
sequences. It includes implementations of a variety of permutation 
distance metrics as well as distance metrics on sequences (i.e., 
Strings, arrays, and other ordered data 
types). [JPT's source code](https://github.com/cicirello/JavaPermutationTools) is 
maintained on GitHub, and the prebuilt jars of the library can be imported 
from [Maven Central](https://search.maven.org/artifact/org.cicirello/jpt) 
using maven or other build tools. The purpose of this repository is to 
demonstrate usage of the major functionality of the JPT library.

## The Example Programs

The source for several example programs is contained in this repository.
Read the comments in the source code of the example programs 
for a description of what they demonstrate, etc. Running the 
examples without reading the source code, and comments, 
is not advised, since the output of the example programs 
requires the context of the code samples to be meaningful.

__Basic Functionality Examples__: The following 
examples are of basic usage of various functionality of the library:
* org.cicirello.examples.jpt.AverageDistance
* org.cicirello.examples.jpt.TableOfDistances
* org.cicirello.examples.jpt.PermutationExamples
* org.cicirello.examples.jpt.SimpleDistanceExamples
* org.cicirello.examples.jpt.SequenceDistanceExamples
* org.cicirello.examples.jpt.PermutationHashCodes
* org.cicirello.examples.jpt.RandomIndexerTimes

__org.cicirello.replication.arxiv2019may__: There are four programs in this package that
replicate the data from the paper that defined the Kendall Tau Sequence Distance, along with
descriptions of the two algorithms for computing it used in the JPT.  Kendall Tau Sequence Distance
is an extension of the well-known Kendall Tau Distance for permutations to be applicable to
Strings and other sequences.  The data generated by these programs is that of the paper:
V.A. Cicirello, "Kendall Tau Sequence Distance: Extending Kendall Tau from Ranks to Sequences," 
arXiv preprint arXiv:1905.02752 [cs.DM]. May 2019. https://www.cicirello.org/publications/cicirello2019arXiv.html.
These four programs are as follows:
* org.cicirello.replication.arxiv2019may.CompareKendallTauSequenceDistAlgsDoubles
* org.cicirello.replication.arxiv2019may.CompareKendallTauSequenceDistAlgsInts
* org.cicirello.replication.arxiv2019may.CompareKendallTauSequenceDistAlgsStrings
* org.cicirello.replication.arxiv2019may.CompareKendallTauSequenceDistAlgsStringArray
