This repository contains several example programs of the 
usage of the [JavaPermutationTools (JPT)](https://jpt.cicirello.org) 
library. The JavaPermutationTools (JPT) library provides Java classes 
and interfaces, etc that enable representing and generating permutations 
and sequences, as well as performing computation on permutations and 
sequences. It includes implementations of a variety of permutation 
distance metrics as well as distance metrics on sequences (i.e., 
Strings, arrays, and other ordered data 
types). [JPT's source code](https://github.com/cicirello/JavaPermutationTools) is 
maintained on GitHub, and the prebuilt jars of the library can be imported 
from [Maven Central](https://central.sonatype.com/artifact/org.cicirello/jpt/) 
using maven or other build tools. The purpose of this repository is to 
demonstrate usage of the major functionality of the JPT library.

## The Example Programs

The source for several example programs is contained in this repository.
Read the comments in the source code of the example programs 
for a description of what they demonstrate, etc. Running the 
examples without reading the source code, and comments, 
is not advised, since the output of the example programs 
requires the context of the code samples to be meaningful.

__Basic Functionality Examples__: The following 
examples are of basic usage of various functionality of the library:
* org.cicirello.examples.jpt.AverageDistance
* org.cicirello.examples.jpt.TableOfDistances
* org.cicirello.examples.jpt.PermutationExamples
* org.cicirello.examples.jpt.SimpleDistanceExamples
* org.cicirello.examples.jpt.SequenceDistanceExamples
* org.cicirello.examples.jpt.PermutationHashCodes
* org.cicirello.examples.jpt.RandomIndexerTimes

__org.cicirello.replication.arxiv2019may__: There are four programs in this package that
replicate the data from the paper that defined the Kendall Tau Sequence Distance, along with
descriptions of the two algorithms for computing it used in the JPT.  Kendall Tau Sequence Distance
is an extension of the well-known Kendall Tau Distance for permutations to be applicable to
Strings and other sequences.  The data generated by these programs is that of the paper:
V.A. Cicirello, "Kendall Tau Sequence Distance: Extending Kendall Tau from Ranks to Sequences," 
arXiv preprint arXiv:1905.02752 [cs.DM]. May 2019. https://www.cicirello.org/publications/cicirello2019arXiv.html.
These four programs are as follows:
* org.cicirello.replication.arxiv2019may.CompareKendallTauSequenceDistAlgsDoubles
* org.cicirello.replication.arxiv2019may.CompareKendallTauSequenceDistAlgsInts
* org.cicirello.replication.arxiv2019may.CompareKendallTauSequenceDistAlgsStrings
* org.cicirello.replication.arxiv2019may.CompareKendallTauSequenceDistAlgsStringArray

__org.cicirello.replication.bict2019.BICT2019__: This program generates the data for the
principal component analysis, as well as the fitness distance correlation data,
from the paper:
V. A. Cicirello, "Classification of Permutation Distance Metrics for Fitness Landscape Analysis," 
in Proceedings of the 11th International Conference on Bio-inspired Information and 
Communications Technologies.  March 2019. https://www.cicirello.org/publications/cicirello2019bict.html.

__org.cicirello.replication.flairs2013.Flairs2013__: This program generates the correlation
data that appears in Tables 1 and 2, as well as the data necessary to generate the
graphs in Figures 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 of the paper:
V. A. Cicirello and R. Cernera, "Profiling the distance characteristics 
of mutation operators for permutation-based genetic algorithms," 
in Proceedings of the 26th FLAIRS Conference. AAAI Press, 
May 2013, pp. 46–51. https://www.cicirello.org/publications/cicirello2013flairs.html.

__org.cicirello.replication.ieeetevc2016.FDC__: This program generates the fitness 
distance correlations for the "Permutation in a Haystack" fitness landscapes 
found in Table II of the paper:
V.A. Cicirello, "The Permutation in a Haystack Problem and the Calculus of Search Landscapes," 
IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation, 20(3):434-446, 
June 2016. https://www.cicirello.org/publications/cicirello2016evc.html.

## Versioning Scheme

The version numbers for the example programs mirror the versions of
[JavaPermutationTools (JPT)](https://jpt.cicirello.org). The version may 
or may not be incremented upon every new release of the JPT library. The 
version number of the examples corresponds to the version of the JPT 
library used in that release.  The examples should run against newer 
versions of the JPT library provided the MAJOR portion of the version 
number is the same.  

The JPT library uses [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) with 
version numbers of the form: MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, where differences 
in MAJOR correspond to incompatible API changes, differences in MINOR 
correspond to introduction of backwards compatible new functionality, 
and PATCH corresponds to backwards compatible bug fixes.

## Prebuilt Jars of the Examples

Since the purpose of the example programs is to demonstrate usage of the
JPT library, you will most likely want to build the examples
directly from the source (see the sections that follow).  However, we
also provide jars of the compiled examples, as well as of the source and javadocs, 
in a variety of ways:
* [GitHub releases](https://github.com/cicirello/jpt-examples/releases)
* [Maven Central](https://central.sonatype.com/artifact/org.cicirello/jpt-examples/)
* [GitHub Packages](https://github.com/cicirello?tab=packages&repo_name=jpt-examples)

If you use the example programs in precompiled form, you will also need
a compatible version of the JPT library, and its dependencies. If you
build the examples from the source, the build process will take care of downloading these
for you. But if you choose to use the prebuilt jars, you can find the jars
of the [JPT library](https://github.com/cicirello/JavaPermutationTools) 
likewise in Maven Central, GitHub Releases, and GitHub Packages.

## Requirements to Build and Run the Example Programs from the Source

To build and run the examples on your own machine, you will need the following:
* __JDK 17__: Beginning with v4.0.0, the minimum supported Java version for the 
  JavaPermutationTools library is Java 17, so you will need Java 17+ for the example programs. 
* __Apache Maven__: In the root of the repository, there is a pom.xml for building the example programs. Using this pom.xml, Maven will take care of downloading the most recent version of the [JavaPermutationTools](https://jpt.cicirello.org/) library for which the examples have been tested, as well as JPT's dependencies. The examples should also work with more recent versions of the library.
* __Make__ (optional): The repository also contains a Makefile to simplify running the build, and running the example programs. If you are familiar with using the Maven build tool, then you can just run these directly, although the Makefile may be useful to see the specific commands needed, such as the main classes to execute for the example programs.

## Building the Example Programs with Maven

The source code of the example programs are
in the [src/main/java](src/main/java) directory.  You can build the example 
programs in one of the following ways:
* Execute `mvn package` at the root of the repository (`mvn compile` should also be sufficient, but only generates `class` files, while `mvn package` generates `jar` files).
* Execute `make` or `make build` at the root of the repository (which simply executes a `mvn package`). 

This build process follows the usual Maven directory structure, so 
the `.class` files, `.jar` files, etc will be found in a `target` 
directory that is created by the build process.

## Running the Example Programs with Maven

Once you have successfully executed the build above, you can run the 
examples of basic library functionality by executing `make examples` 
at the root of the repository. This will run each of the example 
programs in sequence. Be aware that the examples are intended to 
illustrate how to use the JPT library, so will be most meaningful 
if you read the source code, which includes comments explaining what 
they are doing. If you would rather run them one at a time, see 
the `examples` target in the `Makefile` for the main classes to execute.

There are additional examples (see list in earlier section above) that
are based on the experiments of a few published papers that either used 
the library, or which led to the code of the library (i.e., originally 
used preliminary versions of some of the library code). There are 
targets in the makefile for each of these, so you can run those by 
executing the following: `make arxiv2019`, `make bict2019`, 
`make flairs2013`, and `make tevc2016`.
